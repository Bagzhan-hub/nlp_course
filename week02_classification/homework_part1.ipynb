The author of the book further makes all kinds of statements about Vietnamese that with distance sound condiscending or even worse. When the book starts talking about the Vietnamese mind, its almost embarrasing to read it. Yes, it won awards when it was published. But its a very flawed book. For example, the basis of your claim that only 800 people died in the anti-landlord campaign is that her North Vietnamese/NLF friends told the author so.

Palmer, I justified it by writing that \"\"Google returns 13500 hits for the query \"\"Tom G. Palmer\"\" cato [3].\"\" \"\"Tom G. Palmer\"\" alone returns 34,900 hits on Google [4]. So on this point, my vote is not necessarily inconsistent (34,900 > 19,000).\\nWell, sure, but that\\'s weak\"\"35000 is notable, but 19000 isn\\'t\"\". Come on. That\\'s not serious.\\n\\nBut even if you had 50,000 hits on Google, I might also have refrained from voting. This is mainly because I am concerned about you putting so much pressure to have your own article. If I was in your position, I would probably keep my distance from the discussion. You are a primary source of information for yourself and, in that sense, your position might be biased. I am not sure whether your attitude fits with the Neutral point of view policy (which applies to articles, but probably also to the way the encyclopedia should be created as a whole). I don\\'t know, and I prefer to abstain from the vote.\\nUnderstandable, and advice well taken and appreciated. But I am a justice seeker. I really don\\'t care as much if my entry is deleted or not, as for whether I fight to vindicate my unfair treatment (as I perceive it). Here I was, many moon ago, minding my own damn business, and someone tells me I have a Wiki entry. Interesting. Then someone says it\\'s up for delete. What do I care. I really don\\'t give a damn. But some jerk says it\\'s non-notable (okay by meI didn\\'t konw Wiki policies on this at the time anyway); and vanity. Implying I did it, as self-promotion. This pissed me off. I rebutted the latter charge and did not even mention the notable charge. Later, many months later, someone tells me he has initiated VfD for Palmer\\'s site. Now this was right after the Wiki entries of some CLEARLY notable friends of mine were vandalizedHans-Hermann Hoppe, Lew Rockwell with ridiculous charges of racism etc., of the same type made by Palmer. So I figure, let\\'s take a look at his entry. I did so, and in the ensuing VfD debate, realize there are actual policies on this; I studied them and thought, \"\"son of a bitch. I qualify. By their own policies. These wikinerds should not have deleted me. And to top it off, the same one who voted to delete me is voting to keep Palmer. Something ain\\'t right.\"\" So, instead of dishonestly putting up my entry anonymously or through a meatpuppet, I did it myself, nothing hidden. And instead of rolling over and playing dead as I did last time, I decided this time, I will make noise and make sure that if I have anything ot say about it, the voters will be made aware of the policies. That is all. If a fair evaluation of my site and aplication of the policies leads to a good faith vote to delete my entry, I don\\'t care. But what do I see? Peopel who vote to keep Palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay, or has a large number of publications, or has 13000 google hits, voting to delete me, even though I have similar criteria.

First, your statement that the waiters’ accounts cannot be used to support what is independently evident on the video merely because “it was not the scene of a crime” have absolutely no basis in either logic or Wikipedia guidelines. To conclude that a person’s statements must have been made under oath before they can be used to corroborate anything – let alone an event that is independently captured on film (and which lends credibility to the waiters’ accounts itself) – is nothing short of a fiction. I strongly recommend that you re-read WP:CITE and WP:RS. I haven’t dug around for mainstream media outlets reporting the news or the video and its authenticity for that matter (primarily because I just don’t care enough at the moment), but rest assured that if they have or do, I will recognize – compliant with Wikipedia guidelines – any Wikipedian’s citation of it.

From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.\\n\\nHaving returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.\\n\\nAs I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine\\'s skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.\\n\\nThe conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth\\'s black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.\\n\\nIt felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.\\n\\nThe intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.\\n\\nNo words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.\\n\\nI awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as sh',\n       \"I've gone ahead and created the stub article: March of the Soviet Tankmen.

I\\'m trying to understand but all I can make of this is a statement of personal taste, and I\\'m not convinced. Can we try to compare arguments? To me there are two disadvantages to the old format: 1. it contains duplicate information (the \"\"To\"\" column, saying when someone lost the status of oldest person, is always — necessarily so — equal to the person\\'s day of death); 2. it actually is less appealing to me because the information fills more space and there are many line breaks.

By calling everyone under the age of 18 a \"\"child\"\", which the dictionary correctly defines as a human between the ages of infancy and puberty, you can make everything even remotely sexual sound salacious and evil.  Teenagers are insulted to be called \"\"children,\"\" and if you start using terms like \"\"teenage sex\"\" and \"\"teenage sex with adults\"\" to describe problematical behavior by kids old enough to know better, the \"\"poor little abused children\"\" angle is more difficult to sell.

We\\'ve defined it, and we\\'ve linked to many sources who are defining it. The definition is:\\n\\nIt is a form of Judenhass that emanates from the left. It is characterized by the demonization of the world\\'s only Jewish state and of Jews as an ethnicity and a religion. Israel\\'s right to exist as an equal member of the world community is denied. The Jewish people\\'s right of self-determination is denied. Double standards are applied, whereby the actions of the Jewish state are judged according to a different standard from the actions of all the neighboring states around her. Jews as a people are held collectively responsible for the actions of the Jewish state. Symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism are used: for example, blood libels are resurrected, the Jewish state and Jewish people are associated with wild conspiracy theories involving Jews or Zionists or Israelis plotting to take over the world, or being in control of other governments, or being responsible behind the scenes for various acts of terror mistakenly attributed to others. Arab and Islamic anti-Semitism are excused and ignored. Straw-man attacks are made, whereby Jews are alleged to claim that any criticism of Israel is anti-Semitism, and that is then used to condemn Jewish groups as unreasonable, and to deny that there is any such thing as the \"\"new anti-Semitism.\"\" All of the above is accompanied by an international resurgence of violence against Jews and their synagogues and schools, particularly in Europe. It is found in conjunction with anti-Americanism (because Jews are believed either to control or be too influential with the American government), anti-Zionism, and the anti-globalization movement.\\n\\nAll the authoritative sources who have written about the phenomenon agree that these are the key components, so when we find them, we can offer them as examples, so long as someone has discussed them in terms of anti-Semitism or attacks on Jews.  (talk) \\n\\nMy worry is that Livingstone has not been (at least in the sources provided) accused of anti-semitism, and that most of the discussion of Galloway has nothing to do with the allegation of anti-semitism against his supporters.  Add to that that we appear to be accusing them of anti-semitism (not reporting others allegations), which is OR (and unwise in the case of Galloway).  The NUS thing is a bit ephemeral but has been discussed in terms of new anti-semitism so I\\'d just want to tidy that up.  \\n\\nLivingstone has very definitely been accused of anti-Semitism (got into quite a bit of trouble recently over it), as has Galloway, and without question his supporters. The section talks about it in relation to that election. By all means go ahead and clean it up as you see fit, and we can talk later if there are any disagreements.

I have re-read it and can still find none. You \"\"argue that we should make the definition of polygon consistent with what the lay public is likely to encounter and study\"\", while I believe that \"\"the elementary logic of physical objects is best used in the introductory lead\"\". That looks like agreement to me. Where we seem to differ is that you regard this as calling for a Euclidean mathematical definition, while I do not believe that the lay person has sufficient mathematical appreciation for that to be appropriate to the article lead.\\nAs to the actual content, the lead grew historically as a result of several contributors thrashing out our differing approaches. What emerged should not be treated lightly, or substantially edited without prior agreement. I am happy to discuss the rest of your  proposal, and no doubt others will chip in to help reach a consensus. I did restore a little of what you wrote, but in the mean time let us not play ping-pong with the page itself.\\nOn the matter of references, Regular polytopes and Convex polytopes are widely-read works which can hardly be described as specialised: they are indeed precisely what this lay person encountered and studied. Some others which I referenced are original sources - which, out of respect to you as a professional mathematician, I would not pull away from drawing to your attention. Others do move beyond a Euclidean treatment, and were there simply to make the point which begins the subsequent paragraph.\\nMore directly relevant is the issue that most lay people would regard a pentagram as a \"\"star polygon\"\", recognised as such since the days of Archimedes but excluded by the definition you gave, which is more formally understood as a \"\"simple polygon\"\". While mathematicians such as Grünbaum and yourself might choose to frequently omit descriptors such as \"\"simple\"\" or \"\"convex\"\" in treatments of these objects (Grünbaum explicitly, yourself implicitly), a general introduction to the subject can take no such luxury. The article lead should conform as far as is possible to the lay person\\'s preconceptions, whereby polygons may be divided into those which self-intersect and those which do not.\\nWith that proviso, if you have ideas for significant changes to the article lead, I would hope you can share them with us  first. — Cheers,  (Talk) 20:34\"',\n       'I resubmitted and approved it.

( so that outside party is one who saved markets from collapse - not geitner , bernanke , paulson ) this lack of market knowledge by all three , paulson , geitner , and bernanke , is important to understand in understanding depth of market understanding in current proposals to allow us treasury to dictate systemic risk decision , when no one at the us treasury , other than saying those words , has shown any knowledge of markets to be able to determine what that is . / s / harvey keitel , markit bon vivant jr 69.121 . 221.97 iq & markets in the iq discussion in the article it is touted that the bernanke has a higher iq and that qualified him for his job . also it has been mentioned that he is an expert in depression era events . neither worked to have bernanke act appropriately in this global crisis which he / bernanke caused via fighting the spike in oil and gold prices and his efforts directly caused this crisis . so that with bernanke\\'s higher iq did not have him perceive what he was doing would cause a near global market meltdown and his studies of the depression era did not clue him in not to cause nearly a depression . / s too true ioq ix 69.121 . 221.97 demonizing wall street for us government caused crisis in the bubble , all agree was caused by greenspan , and in the huge push to give mortgages to those non qualified which all agree was caused by fannie mae , etc and by congress , this directly lead to the subprime debacle and beginning of the global crisis - none of which was caused by wall street . then in the fight by bernanke to stop the projected inflation caused by oil & gold spikes , his actions massively slammed the overall economy which was perking along just fine even with the subprime debaclev which was a smaller part of the usa $ 15 trillion economy . next , massive jaw boning of the huge crisis was done by paulson to get funds and that caused the coup de grace , the huge retrenchment of all spending by consumers ... all these events were not caused by wall street then paulson , bernanke and later hugely obama and congress , again and again bad mouthed again and again wall street claiming that this whole series of events was caused by wall street when it was mainly caused by the us governement and aided by consumer spending retrenchment but congres and the pundits caused the us population to believe the lie it was wall street\\'s fault due to gambling . all distortion 100 % . destruction of capital formation and wall street one of the key features of bernanke\\'s job in oversight for the usa economy is in also protecting capital formation ... and the engine of economic growth in the usa for 300 years has been the usa efficient capital distribution to new ventures , old ventures , etc and the recent sequence of bad mouthing by all concerned of wall street publicly now and including esp the talking heads on cnn and esp cnbc has severely damaged that core of the reason for usa dominance and leadership for those 300 years . added to that huge destruction is the special refusal by all of the us government to identify and prosecute the huge fraudulent short selling of all major wall street firms and major usa banks which was fraudulent esp as done in a intentional and ever increasing crecend',\n",

       " '\" current squad i propose redoing the current squad list a bit ( for all south african teams ) . during the first half of the year , the top players will play super rugby for the bulls ; during the second half , some of them will play for the springboks . i suggest we list all players in this section that are contracted to the blue bulls , but also indicate if they play at national team level , at super rugby level , at currie cup level or at vodacom cup level only . with the current format , i think the only way possible would be to have some kind of indicator . something like : props dean greyling ( nt ) rayno gerber ( sr ) rossouw de klerk ( cc ) basil short ( vc ) hooker chiliboy ralepelle ( nt ) ( nt ) represented south africa in 2012 ( sr ) represented the in super rugby in 2012 ( cc ) represented the blue bulls in currie cup rugby in 2012 ( vc ) represented the blue bulls in vodacom cup rugby in 2012 the indicator would show the highest level the player played at during the season and players would be sorted by position first , then this indicator , then surname . however , an alternate representation could be : propsnamentsrccvc dean greyling rayno gerber rossouw de klerk basil short hookers chiliboy ralepelle ( nt ) represented south africa in 2012 ( sr ) represented the in super rugby in 2012 ( cc ) represented the blue bulls in currie cup rugby in 2012 ( vc ) represented the blue bulls in vodacom cup rugby in 2012 this could again be sorted by playing position , then level played , then surname . footnotes can be used if a player represented a different super rugby franchise than the main one affiliated with the union , etc . a template ( which is a slight variation on { { rugby squad player } } ) can be developed to simplify this . any thoughts , question , comments , suggestions , criticisms , etc ? \"',\n",

       " '\" unprotected i\\'m going to edit based on my comments in talk : new_anti-semitism #sourcing_claims_for_ . 22country - specific_incidents so could we discuss them now ? all the incidents mentioned are regarded as examples of the new anti-semitism i . e . coming from the left , related to radical anti-zionism etc . ( talk ) they may well be , but they are not sourced that way . i don\\'t think we can expect the words \" \" new anti-semitism \" \" to appear in every single report we reference . we\\'ve defined it , and we\\'ve linked to many sources who are defining it . the definition is : it is a form of judenhass that emanates from the left . it is characterized by the demonization of the world\\'s only jewish state and of jews as an ethnicity and a religion . israel\\'s right to exist as an equal member of the world community is denied . the jewish people\\'s right of self-determination is denied . double standards are applied , whereby the actions of the jewish state are judged according to a different standard from the actions of all the neighboring states around her . jews as a people are held collectively responsible for the actions of the jewish state . symbols and images associated with classic anti-semitism are used : for example , blood libels are resurrected , the jewish state and jewish people are associated with wild conspiracy theories involving jews or zionists or israelis plotting to take over the world , or being in control of other governments , or being responsible behind the scenes for various acts of terror mistakenly attributed to others . arab and islamic anti-semitism are excused and ignored . straw-man attacks are made , whereby jews are alleged to claim that any criticism of israel is anti-semitism , and that is then used to condemn jewish groups as unreasonable , and to deny that there is any such thing as the \" \" new anti-semitism . \" \" all of the above is accompanied by an international resurgence of violence against jews and their synagogues and schools , particularly in europe . it is found in conjunction with anti-americanism ( because jews are believed either to control or be too influential with the american government ) , anti-zionism , and the anti-globalization movement . all the authoritative sources who have written about the phenomenon agree that these are the key components , so when we find them , we can offer them as examples , so long as someone has discussed them in terms of anti-semitism or attacks on jews . ( talk ) my worry is that livingstone has not been ( at least in the sources provided ) accused of anti-semitism , and that most of the discussion of galloway has nothing to do with the allegation of anti-semitism against his supporters . add to that that we appear to be accusing them of anti-semitism ( not reporting others allegations ) , which is or ( and unwise in the case of galloway ) . the nus thing is a bit ephemeral but has been discussed in terms of new anti-semitism so i\\'d just want to tidy that up . livingstone has very definitely been accused of anti-semitism ( got into quite a bit of trouble recently over it ) , as has galloway , and without question his supporters . the section talks about it in relation to that election . by all means go ahead and clean it up as you see fit , and we can talk later if there are any disagreements . ( talk ) slim , whose definition is this ? all the sources put together . the above are the issues they agree on . it was posted weeks ago . ( talk ) i think you mean \" \" all the sources from one side of the argument put together \" \" . it\\'s been a while since we discussed this , so could you remind me as to which sources you consider authoritative ? sorry , you\\'ll have to look in the archives ; they\\'re either there or in the article . by \" \" all the sources , \" \" i mean all the sources who study new anti-semitism . the above are the elements they appear to agree on .
